excerpt: 'The default mode network (DMN) is a workspace for convergence of internal and external information. The frontal parietal network (FPN) is indispensable to executive functioning. Yet, how they interplay to support cognitive development remains elusive. Using longitudinal developmental fMRI with an n-back paradigm, we show heterogeneity of maturational changes in multivoxel activity and network connectivity among DMN and FPN nodes in 528 children and 103 young adults. Compared with adults, children exhibited prominent longitudinal improvement but still inferior behavioral performance, which paired with less pronounced DMN deactivation and weaker FPN activation in children, but stronger DMN coupling with FPN regions. Children’s DMN reached an adult-like level earlier than FPN at both multivoxel activity pattern and intra-network connectivity levels. Intrinsic DMN-FPN internetwork coupling in children mediated the relationship between age and working memory-related functional coupling of these networks, with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) coupling emerging as the most prominent pathway. The coupling of PCC-DLPFC may further work together with task-invoked activity in PCC to account for the longitudinal improvement in behavioral performance in children. Our findings suggest that the DMN provides a scaffolding effect in support of an immature FPN that is critical for the development of executive functions in children.'
