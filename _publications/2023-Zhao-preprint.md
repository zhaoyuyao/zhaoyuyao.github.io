Growth mindset is known for its positive impact on learning, problem-solving, and achievement by fostering the belief that one’s abilities can be improved through continuous effort. Theories attributed the promotive effect to its optimization on cognitive and motivational processes, while relevant evidence remained scattered. Although recent studies identified pathways related to growth mindset, we still lack a comprehensive model linking its impacts on cognitive process, brain system dynamics and long-term outcomes. Here, we showed that the growth mindset promoted the development of working memory (WM) through dynamic coordination of the cortico-striatal system and tested its longitudinal effects on decisive processes over three years. Behaviorally, growth mindset improves WM outcomes via accelerating the latent evidence accumulation process, as revealed by the computational modeling on trial-by-trial WM decisive response. Developmental neuroimaging further revealed that the coactivation of the striatum-cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal systems plays a significant role in such long-term WM improvements. By leveraging Hidden Markov Modeling on cortico-striatal dynamics, we identified two distinct brain states that explain the relationship between the growth mindset and behavioral improvements. The enhanced while flexible cortico-striatal activity mediated the long-term optimization of growth mindset on the evidence accumulation process in WM. Our findings revealed the optimization of growth mindset on cortico-striatal latent dynamics and, for the first time, established a longitudinal model linking the impact of the growth mindset on neural orchestration to cognitive processes and behavioral outcomes.
