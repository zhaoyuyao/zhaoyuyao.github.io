Welcome! I am a PhD student in the [Cognitive Psychology PhD program](https://cogpsych.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). I went to college at the Beijing Normal University and earned my BS and MS degrees in Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience. After graduation, I continued my PhD studies in the US with Dr. Jessica Cohen and colleagues in the [Cohen Lab](https://cohenlab.web.unc.edu/). 

My projects focus on the functional organization and network interplay underlying cognitive control in different contexts and their typical and atypical neurodevelopment from infancy to adulthood. Outside of my research, I enjoy drawing, hiking, and biking.
