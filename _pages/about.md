Hi! This is Yuyao Zhao, a PhD student in the Cognitive Psychology PhD program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I graduated from Beijing Normal University with BS and MS degrees in Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience. I am currently working with Dr. Jessica Cohen in the Cohen Lab. My projects focus on the functional organization and network interplay underlying cognitive control in different contexts and their typical and atypical neurodevelopment from infancy to adulthood. Outside of her studies, I enjoy drawing, hiking, and biking.
