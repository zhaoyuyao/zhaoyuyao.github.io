## Leading Projects
### Maternal psychiatric history and childrenâ€™s executive function development and psychopathology (manuscript)
Maternal psychiatric history significantly impacts the future well-being of offspring. We found that high-risk children exhibited elevated EF impairments and psychopathology symptoms compared to the low-risk group over six years. Improvements in EF predicted reductions in psychopathological symptoms, and relatively intact EF protected high-risk children from developing clinically significant psychopathology. The poster of this project was presented at the annual conference of the Triangle Society of Neuroscience in 2024.
  
### Cortico-striatal interaction in working memory and effect of growth mindset (preprint)
The growth mindset benefits the development of working memory capacity in school-aged children. Via analyzing imaging data, we found that the growth mindset promoted working memory through enhanced frontoparietal, salience network activity and cortico-striatal interactions. Moreover, the reconfiguration of networks prepared children for demanding tasks in the future.

## Cooperating Projects
### Neural reconfiguration of the multiple-demand system and math performance during childhood and adolescence (manuscript)
The brain organization underlies multiple executive functions is also strongly associated with math performance, which is challenging but crucial in primary education. We found that the dynamic mechanisms of multiple-demand systems identified during four executive function tasks predicted individual math performance during childhood and adolescence. The poster of this project was presented at the annual conference of the Society of Neuroscience in 2024.

### Default mode network scaffolds immature frontoparietal network in working memory development (published)
The default mode network (DMN) is a workspace for the convergence of internal and external information. The frontal parietal network (FPN) is indispensable to executive functioning. We investigated how they interplay to support cognitive development. The findings showed that the DMN provides a scaffolding effect in support of an immature FPN that is critical for the development of executive functions in children.

### Positive coping and hippocampal-neocortical maturation (preprint)
The positive coping style is a key buffer against vulnerability to stress. We investigated the neurobiological mechanisms behind positive coping in children undergoing rapid brain development. The findings revealed that positive coping promotes hippocampal function through response in the endocrinal system and shapes hippocampal-neocortical functional systems involved in negative emotion processing.
